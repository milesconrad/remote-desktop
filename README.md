# remote-desktop
A remote desktop app built in python, using the `pynput` and `socket` modules. Just a fun little project I made for school.

Before running server.py, you will need to install the pynput and pickle modules through pip. You will also need to make sure you have port forwarding for port 600 on your computer set up.
